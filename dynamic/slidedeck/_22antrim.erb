    <p><strong>THE PROCESS</strong> is defined as a collection of actions that allow a person to progress toward a desired result.</p>
    <p>Immediate as well as lifetime achievements are the culmination of successfully executed maneuvers in succession over an extended period of time.</p>
    <p>The road towards understanding ourselves and the infinite possibilities lay in the experience of the process. The major lessons in life are in the failures we experience along the journey towards our true potential. Personal accomplishment is generated by focus on action with intention. It is necessary to observe our goals and ambitions in order to formulate a plan. Not all streams have stones for you to cross on. Staying focused on each step will allow for the necessary end result: To get where we want to go.</p>
    <p>In the forum of athletics, athletes and coaches often dream of being hoisted on shoulders in celebration. Very few dream of the sacrifices that it will take to get there. Only when we attend to the achievement of daily objectives will we understand the endless opportunities our efforts provide.</p>
    <p>Successful people remember the strain filled times when they finally moved beyond their challenge, and designate those events as being why they achieved their goals.</p>
    <p>Life teaches us that the moments collected, the miles traveled, and the time absorbed will yield the life we want.</p>
    <p>Commit to the PROCESS until you find yourself amongst your results. If you do not work the process you can never achieve those results. What will you commit to?</p>
