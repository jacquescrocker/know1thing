    <p><strong>If I would have known just one thing</strong> it would have been to shut up, listen, and ask a ton of questions.</p>
    <p>Asking questions provides you with a gateway to knowledge, surrounding yourself with people who are smarter than you (and believe me, they are out there, and there’s no doubt people who are smarter than them) and asking them how they do what they do, is the only way you and I will ever learn anything.</p>
    <p>Admitting you don't know everything, admitting you’re not invincible...that's half the battle - that's where most of get stuck. We're proud, we think we know everything, and we're not willing to admit when we don't...</p>
    <p>But if there is just one thing to take away from this, it's that you don't know everything, and that asking questions is the hands down absolute best way to get where you want to be; personally AND professionally.</p>
    <p>Being stubborn has held me back in the past, safe to say it has you as well - don't let it anymore. In today's world, people are willing to help - you just have to be willing to ask for it.</p>
